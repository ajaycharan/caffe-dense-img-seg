# Caffe 
**This is a fork from https://github.com/HyeonwooNoh/DeconvNet but modified for different per-pixel segmentation algorithms with the following support.**
  0. CRFasRNN from the recent paper "Conditional Random Fields as Recurrent Neural Networks". 
  0. Uncertainty using drop-out "Dropout as bayesian approximation: Representing model uncertainty in deep learning".
  0. Floating point data type for input channels e.g. depth, height from ground plane and angle with gravity vector "SynthCam3D: Semantic Understanding With Synthetic Indoor Scenes".
